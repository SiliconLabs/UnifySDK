 * @brief MQTT client interface
 *
 * This component implement an mqtt client interface. The the mqtt client
 * features connection state management, with re-connect on disconnects and
 * cashing of publish messages in case the a publish message cannot be delivered
 * to the broker.
 *
 * Other components can use the MQTT component to subscribe (@ref
 * uic_mqtt_subscribe) to MQTT topics and register callbacks when new messages
 * arrives.
 *
 * This api also features publishing messages(@ref uic_mqtt_publish) and keeping
 * track on which messages has been published with the retained flag such that
 * they mey be un-retaind again if desired (@ref uic_mqtt_unretain  @ref
 * uic_mqtt_unretain_by_regex).
