Introduction
------------

The Unify Framework delivers a unified high-level API, such as cloud control,
local HomeAssistant middle-wares, and so on to control, observe and manage
end nodes in all PHYs supported by Silicon Labs. It also facilitates code
reuse and allows easily adding new high-level APIs without the need to modify
the PHY drivers. After a new high-level API module has been created, it should
be possible to control all the supported PHYs without any changes to the PHY
drivers. Likewise, after a new PHY driver has been created, it should
immediately be possible to control that PHY from all the existing high-level
APIs without modifying the high-level API module.

In other words, the Unify Framework decouples API modules from the PHY drivers.

The Unify Framework is a software component that runs inside a gateway product.
It needs a hardware platform and an operating system to be a complete product.

  Gateway Asset components

From a business perspective, Unify makes it possible to maintain a single IoT
Service that can interface with multiple wireless PHY radios. The functionality
includes SmartStart, best-in-class security, firmware updates, and so on.
Unify makes it easier to develop gateway products by driving down the marginal
effort needed in launching the next customer gateway and enables rapid
development cycles.

The remainder of this document refers to PHY drivers as Protocol Controllers
because they not only drive the modem but also translate the Application
Layer commands from one PHY technology to another. Similarly, the high-level
API modules are called IoT Services, which are named after the expected use
case, but they can also connect to locally running services.

System Components
-----------------

The Unify Framework is a software component of a full plastic-enclosed GW box.
You can think of it as a "device driver" for the IoT, seen from the Host MCU
in the GW box. The Unify component uses MQTT as an internal message-bus for
inter-process communication among MQTT clients that are each an independent
process/thread. In a Linux or other full OS implementation, real processes
should be used. The primary hardware platform of the Unify design is a
Cortex A-class device or an equivalent.

The MQTT clients are one of these types:

* IoT Services (or IoT services): These modules expose the externally-visible
  APIs in Unify. IoT Services translate back and forth between external APIs
  and the intermediate UCL. The external API is typically consumed by a
  cloud-service or a local middleware/app. It is slightly confusing
  that an IoT Service can also provide APIs to a locally-running service. It
  is named after the expected use case, which is a cloud-based remote control.
  Examples of IoT Services include:

  * AWS IoT
  * HomeAssistant
  * Azure IoT
  * Rules Engines (even if running locally)
  * Web UI for local control

* Protocol Controllers: These MQTT clients own a physical radio operated
  through Unify. They also translate from UCL to the native language of
  the radio. Examples include the following:

  * Zigbee Protocol Controller owning an NCP
  * Z-Wave Protocol Controller owning a SerialAPI
  * BLE Protocol Controller
  * BLE-Mesh Protocol Controller
  * Silicon Labs Connect Stack Protocol Controller

* A singleton Resource Directory MQTT client, responsible for aggregating
  node information and providing the ``ucl/+/discover`` topic for discovering
  nodes, where ``+`` can be one of (by-unid, by-location, by-roletype,
  by-devicetype, by-group).

System Diagram
--------------

:numref:`figure_architecture_block_diagram` shows the overall architecture and
some of the technologies that Unify connects.

Because a central MQTT broker and standardized MQTT topics and JSON
payload (the UCL) are used, the architecture is more like a star topology,
as shown in :numref:`figure_uic_system_diagram`:

  :name: figure_uic_system_diagram

  Unify System diagram

:numref:`figure_uic_system_diagram` shows the overall Unify architecture with
MQTT as an integral part. IoT Services (blue boxes) for AWS IoT, Azure,
HomeAssistant and so on are shown. Protocol Controllers (green boxes) for all
Silicon Labs PHYs are possible, with a random selection of Z-Wave, Zigbee,
and Bluetooth shown. All IoT Services and Protocol Controllers are
connected by a common Unify abstraction layer consisting of an MQTT broker
transporting the Unify Controller Language. Clients can roughly be grouped
into IoT Services, local middlewares, Protocol Controllers, and a Singleton
Resource Directory.

The Resource Directory is also an MQTT client.

The MQTT server should run as a separate Linux process.

The Resource Directory facilitates device discovery and communicates with each
Protocol Controller through specific MQTT topics. The Protocol Controller MUST
automatically notify the Resource Directory of nodes that join or leave the
network, as well as multicast groups that are added/removed/modified.

Design Variants
'''''''''''''''

Unify gateways comes in a few variants that differ in the number of PHYs
controlled:

* A multi-homed Unify gateway has several Protocol Controllers installed.
  This is a more complicated product to develop and market.

* A single-homed Unify gateway has a single Protocol Controller and relies on MQTT
  bridging and/or Cloud Services to connect to other PHYs. To unify two PHYs, you need
  two physical Unify-based gateways, which must be connected to the same
  IP network or cloud service. The two single-Protocol Controller Unify GWs
  communicate via MQTT bridging and UCL or via a Cloud Service they are both
  connected to. The single-homed Unify GW is a simpler product to develop, allows
  the developer to focus solely on the PHY they are most comfortable with, and
  still end up with a complete, functional, gateway product. The process of
  interconnecting multiple independent single-Protocol Controller Unify GWs can be
  thought of as the "LEGO-block design principle for Unify".

Another variant of the design uses MQTT bridging to allow multiple Unify
gateways to cooperatively control and manage the same PAN. The bridging may
happen either locally or in the cloud.

  Block UG design

:numref:`figure_slide20_lego_block_ug_design` shows an example of 3
single-Protocol Controller Unify-based gateways, that when connected to the
same IP backbone can unify Zigbee, Z-Wave and the AWS IoT cloud service.
Each gateway is represented by a green, blue or yellow rectangle, showing
which connectors it has attached.

Packet Format
-------------

When Unify MQTT clients attach to the locally-running MQTT broker, they
publish and receive messages in the following format (i.e., a tcpdump attached to
the sockets going to and from the MQTT Broker, would see the packets in the
:numref:`figure_universal_gw_packet_format` and
:numref:`figure_universal_gw_packet_subscribe_format`).

If the MQTT broker is running remotely, the MQTT MUST be using strong transport
encryption to provide adequate security (e.g., MQTT over TLS or WebSocket).

Unify Controller Language Definition
------------------------------------

The Unify Controller Language (UCL) is developed to allow the easiest possible
translation to and from as many PHYs and cloud services as possible. The UCL
serves as an abstraction layer between the PHY-specific data models and the
models used in various cloud services for controlling IoT devices. The UCL data
model MUST be the
Zigbee Cluster Library |ZCL2019| / DotDot
(DotDot is ZCL transported over CoAP, whereas UCL will be transported
over MQTT). ZCL has been chosen to align
Unify with the high-profile `Matter project <https://csa-iot.org/>`__.

In addition to the existing Zigbee Clusters, UCL is extended with the necessary
commands to support all features of the supported PHYs.

UNID: Unified Node IDs
----------------------

The UNIDs are unique text strings in the MQTT topic hierarchy, which MUST
follow the MQTT naming limitations.

The Protocol Controllers generate UNID for all nodes in the PAN (or PANs) it
controls. The UNID MUST consist of a prefix part and a PAN part, separated by a
minus string character "-".

The PAN part MUST be generated by the Protocol Controller and MUST be unique
among PAN parts generated by that PC. The Protocol Controller MUST prefix all
UNIDs with the same prefix. This prefix must be configurable at startup. The
system integrator MUST ensure that no two Protocol Controllers have the same
prefix configured. The prefix ensures that separate Protocol Controllers never
generate the same UNID and hence keeps them unique.

:numref:`table_unify_specifications_unid_examples` shows examples of generated
UNIDs:

.. list-table:: UNID examples
  :name: table_unify_specifications_unid_examples
  :widths: 30 20 50
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Protocol Controller PHY
    - Prefix
    - Example UNID
  * - Z-Wave
    - "zw"
    - "zw-DEADBEEF-0001" for NodeID 01 in HomeID 0xDEADBEEF.
      NodeID is mutable on network reset.
  * - Zigbee
    - "zb"
    - "zb-DEADBEEFC0FFEE12" for node with EUI-64 DEADBEEFC0FFEE12.
  * - BLE
    - "ble-sr"
    - Static random addresses. "ble-sr-112233445566" for a BLE device with
      random identifier 11:22:33:44:55:66.
  * - BLE
    - "ble-pd"
    - Public device addresses. "ble-sr-112233445566" for a BLE device with
      public address 11:22:33:44:55:66.

For example, Z-Wave UNIDs could be prefixed "zw", zigbee with "zb", and so on.
The prefix should be short (max 8-10 characters) to keep MQTT topics short.

The UNID PAN parts can be derived from a unique identifier, such as the EUI-64 of a
Bluetooth LE or Zigbee device. For devices without a permanent unique
identifier, something like the currently assigned address on the PAN can
be used, for example a combination of HomeID and
NodeID in Z-Wave.

Mutable UNID PAN parts may be used instead of permanent identifiers if they
allow simpler diagnostics and troubleshooting of the system. This may be
the case when choosing Z-Wave HomeID/NodeIDs instead of S2 DSKs. The
disadvantage is that nodes will change their UNID when the network is reset or
leaving and re-joining.

MQTT Topic Hierarchical Namespace
---------------------------------

MQTT topics are hierarchical namespaces that any MQTT client can publish and
subscribe to. Subscriptions can use wildcards where # match multiple hierarchy
levels and + matches one. As a result, subscribing to ucl/by-unid/# gets all
ACs for all PAN nodes. On the other hand, subscribing to
``ucl/by-unid/+/+/DoorLock/#`` receives only data related to Door Lock Cluster
functionality on any and all Door Locks in the network.

The topic tree looks like the following:

.. code-block:: none

  ucl/
    by-unid/
      <UNID>                            UNID can be e.g. "xy-123456-05" or  "bld42-<EUI-64>".
        ep<EndPointID>                  The endpoint to control/monitor. ep0 is used for devices
                                        without PAN-side endpoints.
          <ClusterName>                 Everything relating to a specific Cluster, e.g. "ColorControl".

              <AttributeName>           Attribute name, e.g "ColorCapabilities".
                Reported                Reported state for a given attribute.

                                        ZCL Tables may use more than 1 level. E.g. "SceneTable".
                ../Reported             Reported state for a given attribute. ".." represents several levels. E.g. "SceneTable/1"
                ../Desired              Desired state for a given attribute.
            SupportedCommands           Array of supported commands accepted by the cluster.

The <DEVICETYPE> MUST adequately describe the Device Types (i.e.,
the practical functions) of all the device types found in all PANs
supported by Silicon Labs. The
`dotdot Device Library specification <https://zigbeealliance.org/solution/dotdot/>`__
has a good list of device types.

The <HOMEASSISTANT_TYPE> MUST be a strict superset of the
`MQTT discovery types defined in the HomeAssistant open-source project <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/>`__.

The subscribers to the ucl/_well_known topic/+ MUST receive a
`JSON-encoded <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp>`__
`Retained Message <(https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/>`__
with at least the following contents:

**The JSON-encoded well-known payload:**

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "schema_version" : 1,
    "wellknown_topics" :
    [
      {"name" : "ucl/by-unid", "description" : "All nodes grouped by UNID"},
      {"name" : "ucl/by-location", "description" : "All nodes grouped by location"},
      {"name" : "ucl/SmartStart", "description" : "SmartStart management"},
      {"name" : "ucl/by-group/", "description" : "Multicast transmission and group management"}
    ]
  }


Each protocol controller MUST publish the well known topics they provide under
``ucl/_well_known/<UNID>``

Payload Encoding
----------------

Everything after the Cluster, Command, Attribute and Table field in a given
dotdot ZCL command must be encoded in the payload of the MQTT message. The UCL
header must also be JSON-encoded in the format given in the example below.

Field names are taken from the Zigbee Cluster Library. Camel-case is used to
encode spaces, forward slashes are omitted (On/Off → OnOff).

Payload Versioning
------------------

Future extensions of the ZCL or Unify framework MAY add new information in the
existing fields of a JSON payload.

IoT services and Protocol Controllers MUST be resistant to unknown/new
keys or key values when parsing JSON objects.

As an example, the following payload:

.. code-block:: json

  { "value" : 1 }


May be extended in a future version to something alike:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "value" : 1,
    "value_options": [1,2,3]
  }

Protocol Controller and IoT Service MQTT Clients
------------------------------------------------

The MQTT clients connecting to the MQTT broker of a Unify gateway can very
broadly be divided into two categories: Protocol Controllers and IoT Services.
These were also called PHY Translator/Connectors and Cloud
Connectors/Translators previously.

A Protocol Controller is an MQTT client that runs in its own OS process. It can
be written in any language and run on any platform that provides an MQTT client.

A Protocol Controller MUST implement these interfaces

* Unify Interface. The interface between the MQTT Broker and each Protocol
  Controller. This is an MQTT pub/sub connection, with topics and payloads
  specified by the UCL.

* PAN interface: NCP, SerialAPI or similar PHY-specific interface.

An IoT Service MUST implement this interface:

* Unify Interface. The interface between the MQTT Broker and each Protocol
  Controller. This is an MQTT pub/sub connection with topics and payloads
  specified by the UCL.

An IoT Service MAY implement this interface:

* Cloud Interface: Interface from Cloud Service to IoT Service module in the
  Unify gateway. The first example is an AWS-IoT IoT Service module. Rules
  Engines can also be seen as special instances of IoT Services. The Cloud
  Interface is defined by the cloud service and implemented by the IoT Service.

Protocol Controller API
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Each Protocol Controller connects to the MQTT server.
The Protocol Controller subscribes for example to an MQTT topic:

> ``ucl/by-unid/#``

When packets are received, the Protocol Controller must drop all messages where
the UNID prefix does not match the manually-configured prefix of the Protocol
Controller. For example, the Zigbee Protocol Controller may be manually
configured to handle all UNIDs starting with, for example, `zb-example-pc-*` prefix, and
the BLE Protocol Controller might be configured for `ble001-*`. They will each
drop everything with UNID not matching that prefix.

A Protocol Controller MUST publish a message to the topic
``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/State`` to notify the IoT Services of the new node.

It MUST also process and translate all commands from a topic
``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/+/+`` to the PAN (i.e., the PHY Radio it owns), if the
``<UNID>`` matches the prefix assigned to the Protocol Controller. The Cluster
and Command is derived by the Protocol Controller from the wildcard part of the
received topic and translated to PAN-specific commands as the Protocol
Controller sees fit. The UCL header in the MQTT payload must also be examined as
part of the translation to the native language. The translation of one UCL
command MAY result in a sequence of PHY native commands. For example, one UCL command
may be translated to a sequence of Z-Wave commands and then transmitted through
the NCP.

When commands are received from the PAN, a Protocol Controller must translate
and publish to the MQTT topic
``ucl/by-unid/<source_UNID>/ep<ID>/<ClusterName>/Attributes/<AttributeName>/Reported``
with a UCL header and translated CMD payload in the MQTT payload field.
The Protocol Controller must fill out the UCL header fields in addition to
concatenating with the translated payload.

When commands are received from the PAN, a Protocol Controller may
additionally publish on the MQTT topic:
``ucl/by-unid/<source_UNID>/ep<ID>/<ClusterName>/GeneratedCommands/<CommandName>``


See :ref:`unify_specifications_chapter_zcl_in_unify_application_level_control`
for details.

**Protocol Controller responsibilities**:

1. Protocol Controller starts up and queries the current state of all PAN Nodes.
2. Configure all PAN nodes to send updates to the NCP controller by the Protocol Controller.
3. Whenever node state changes, publish to
   ``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndPointID>/<Cluster>`` for all UNIDs/EndPointIDs
   in its PAN and for all Clusters supported. This allows IoT Services to
   discover nodes and read out the state by subscribing to
   ``ucl/by-unid/+/+/<Cluster>/#``.
4. Subscribe to ``ucl/by-unid/#`` and siphon off only the UNIDs assigned to
   this Protocol Controller.
5. Translate Clusters, Commands/WriteAttributes and
   Commands/ForceReadAttributes published to the node from UCL to the
   native Application Layer language of the PAN. Finally, transmit the
   translated sequence of frames to the radio.
6. Handle multicast:

  a. Subscribe to ``ucl/by-group/+/+/+`` . The first wildcard is the group
     ID being multicasted to. The Protocol Controller monitors group IDs,
     and when appropriate multicasts to nodes in the PAN it controls.
     If the PAN or nodes do not support multicast, singlecast frames will be
     transmitted instead.

  b. Subscribe to ``ucl/by-unid/+/+/Groups/+/+``. Group management is done via
     the Groups cluster, so the Protocol Controller monitors all group
     management for nodes it controls. It maintains a list mapping groups to
     nodes it controls.

IoT Service API
'''''''''''''''

When creating IoT Service modules, the main goal is to keep this
interface simple and easy to implement correctly, securely, and robustly.

A cloud controller must implement an MQTT Client and TLS transport for the MQTT
connection. Unify abstracts away the differences between end-nodes on
different PHYs. The IoT Service can use a single unified API for all PHY types.
This is a primary goal of Unify.

.. note::

  PHY-specific APIs MAY be added on demand, but a single API
  covering all PHYs is strongly preferred. Of course, exceptions will arise over
  the coming years as PHY technologies develop at break-neck pace and Unify may
  as well be pragmatic about it. The UCL API is expected to develop with the PHY
  technologies.

An IoT Service MUST implement at least the following API sections.

IoT Service API for Discovering, Controlling, and Requesting Reports
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An IoT Service that wants to control a command in a cluster on a device with a
given UNID MUST publish on the topic:

> ``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndPointID>/<ClusterName>/Commands/<CommandName>``

It should also subscribe to the following topic filter to be notified of any
state update.

> ``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndPointID>/<ClusterName>/Attributes/#``

AWS IoT Service (or any other IoT Service) can do the following:

* Subscribe to ``ucl/by-unid/#`` to get all messages from the Protocol Controllers
* Discover devices in one of these ways:

  * Discover all devices by subscribing to topic ``ucl/by-unid/+/+/State``
    The client will receive a retained discovery message about on all available
    nodes and their endpoints.
  * In a specific location by subscribing to topic ``ucl/by-location/living_room/+``
  * Discover which device types are available by subscribing to
    ``ucl/by-type/by-devicetype/#``, which will yield a number of retained messages
    containing the UNID/endpoint of each node.

* Discover locations by

  * First discovering locations by subscribing to ``ucl/by-location/#``.
    The client will now receive a retained message from each location with the
    MQTT-compatible name in the topic and the pretty-printed display name of the
    location in the JSON payload. This message has been sent by the
    Resource Directory, based on individual location announcements from nodes.
  * Discovering nodes in the location by subscribing to a topic filter such
    as ``ucl/by-location/<LocationName>/+``. The publications will be retained
    messages advertising each node in that location. The MQTT payload will simply
    be the UNID repeated from the topic string, e.g., ``{ "unid":"32049350" }``.
    The node can then be probed and actuated in the ``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>`` namespace.

A subscribed IoT Service receives the following MQTT payload: UCL hdr | CMD payload
(Refer to :numref:`figure_universal_gw_packet_subscribe_format`).

AWS IoT issue commands by publishing to
``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndPointID>/<ClusterName>/Commands/<CommandName>``
for a fire-and-forget transmission. On the PAN side, all reliability and
acknowledgment mechanisms will be used, but there will be no acknowledgment on
the MQTT client side.

An IoT Service should subscribe to
``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndPointID>/<ClusterName>/Attributes/#``
to be notified of attribute state changes.
The attribute changes reported will report if and when the command has been
carried out.

IoT Services must translate the entire UCL message including payload into
whatever format the Cloud Provider uses.

Implementation Recommendations for IoT Services
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

IoT Service Reference Designs should preferably not be written in C
to avoid whole classes of common security and stability bugs, such as buffer
overflows and use-after-free pointer errors. Instead, a high level language with
focus on security MUST be used. Rust is a very good candidate with broad
HW platform support and focus on secure programs.

The Resource Directory MQTT Client
----------------------------------

A singleton Resource Directory MQTT client, responsible for aggregating node
information and providing the ``ucl/+/discover`` interface for discovering nodes,
where ``+`` can be one of (by-unid, by-location, by-type, by-clustercommand).
The Resource Discovery works in the following way:

* It is the only MQTT client guaranteed to connect immediately after the Unify broker starts up.

* It MUST add the NameLocation cluster to all nodes added to the Unify GW and
  handle all aspects of updating and discovering the name and location. The
  Protocol Controllers are not required to do anything regarding Name and
  Location.

  * RD subscribes to ``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndPointID>/NameAndLocation`` and
    stores all writes to the Name and Location attributes. This is done for
    each UNID and EndPointID in the network.
  * RD publishes to ``ucl/by-location/<LOCATION>/<UNID>``
    with payload ``{"unid":"987654321"}`` so other clients can discover
    the nodes by their location.
    All endpoints are assumed to be in the same location.
  * RD publishes to ``ucl/by-location/<LOCATION>`` with a payload of
    ``{"location-name-utf8" : "Children's Room"}``. This allows location discovery by
    other clients. ``<LOCATION>`` is a valid MQTT topic name derived from the
    full UTF-8 location name.

* It MUST manage the global SmartStart provisioning list, which is common to
  all Protocol Controllers.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Mandatory TLS Transport on Remote Access
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

TCP (non-TLS) MQTT transport for local connection SHOULD NOT be allowed. Raw TCP transport (non-TLS) MUST be rejected for remote connections including all non-monolithic variants with a remote MQTT broker.

MUST transport MQTT over TLS or WebSockets for Bridged Broker.

The type of TLS negotiated
`MUST be strong <https://www.w3.org/TR/wsc-ui/#typesoftls>`__ and the Trust Anchors
used to validate certificates must be carefully selected. The trust anchors used
in the PKI for public web browsers MUST NOT be used for Unify gateways. Instead,
a trust anchor should be created and installed for a particular GW product.
Unify should provide an example and make it easy for Unify integrators and
manufacturing partners to generate and replace the trust anchor with their own.

Unify Process Isolation
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The Unify processes (Protocol Controllers, Resource Directory, IoT Services) MUST
be hardened against malformed input thorough input validation, for example, should
avoid common bug classes, such as array out-of-bounds addressing and pointer errors
by design. It is RECOMMENDED to use memory safe languages (not C/C++). The
processes SHOULD adopt the
`principle of least privileges <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>`__,
and not require root privileges to run. If a root is required, the processes
SHOULD drop the privileges after initialization. A similar hardening SHOULD be
applied to the MQTT Broker, although this will probably be a third-party
implementation, at least in the first several phases of the Unify project.

The Protocol Controller and Resource Directory processes handle sensitive crypto
key material (at least the certificates and private keys for establishing TLS
session with MQTT broker, potentially also PAN network keys). PAN encryption
keys SHOULD (MUST in later phase) be stored in the PHY radio chip whenever
possible to protect from adversarial processes on the Unify GW itself.
Therefore, it must be protected against hostile processes reading the memory of
the Unify software. Similarly, the Unify software must have exclusive access to
the radios, so hostile processes cannot inject commands into the PAN. This must
be achieved through OS access control mechanisms.

Broker Discovery
----------------

To interact with the Unify GW and the PAN nodes behind it, the IP address of the
broker must be discovered. The mechanism of discovery is not yet defined, but
the most likely candidate is
`Multicast DNS (mDNS) <(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS>`__. Once
connected, Resource Discovery MUST be used to discover the nodes and
capabilities of the PAN nodes.

Sleepy Devices
--------------

Protocol Controller must manage sleepy devices in the optimal way for each PHY.
MQTT retained messages SHOULD be used to cache the latest status from a sleepy device.

Z-Wave Battery Device
'''''''''''''''''''''

Z-Wave Protocol Controllers must handle messages to Sleepy Devices,
which are known as Battery Devices or devices implementing the
Wake Up Command Class, in the following way:

Whenever a Battery Device is included in the PAN, the Protocol Controller
MUST set itself as the Lifeline of that node (if allowed) (i.e., make the node
report all status commands to the Protocol Controller). The Battery Node
will send Wake Up Notification Commands to the Protocol Controller whenever
it is available for two-way communication.
Usually the frequency is selected to achieve a certain battery life.

After a message for a particular battery device has been published, and again
when the message has been delivered and acknowledged on the application layer,
the Protocol Controller must publish attribute state updates to their
respective topics
(``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/ep<EndpointIdD>/<ClusterName>/Attributes/Reported``).

The state must be described both by a
`"desired" and "reported" states <https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Designing_MQTT_Topics_for_AWS_IoT_Core.pdf>`__.

The desired state must be updated when the message has been received by the
Protocol Controller. When the message has been application layer acknowledged
by the PAN Node ("the garage door is now fully lowered and closed"), another
update must be published, this time changing the "reported" state. of
the Cluster attrbutes. The Supervision Command Class can be used to
obtain application level confirmations in Z-Wave.

Mailbox
-------

Protocol Controllers will let IoT Service issue commands to sleepy devices
whenever they want to. Protocol Controllers are responsible for reflecting
the desired state change for the attributes that are affected by the command.

The Protocol Controllers must subsequently issue all pending commands to the
sleepy devices whenever communication becomes possible again.

IoT Services may expect to wait a delay in seconds (``MaximumCommandDelay``)
advertised in the state topic ``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>State`` for each
node before commands are delivered to the end node.


Refer to the :ref:`unify_specifications_chapter_service_discovery`
for details about the the node state topic.

.. _unify_specifications_section_reportable_unsolicited_messages_from_the_pan:

Reportables/Unsolicited Messages from the PAN
---------------------------------------------

A IoT Service that wants to receive Reportables (a.k.a. unsolicited messages)
from a PAN node MUST have a well-defined way to subscribe to all events from
a PAN node. An IoT Service must also be able to subscribe to all event
notifications from a particular cluster by subscribing to the topic
``ucl/by-unid/<UNID>/#``. The IoT Service will then receive all reportables
from the <UNID> device along with all commands sent to it.

.. note::

  IoT Services should evaluate the PAN node security level before
  trusting reportables/unsolicited messages received from the PAN.

To receive event notifications from multiple devices, MQTT topic wildcards can be used.

True Status and Almost True Status for Sleepy Devices
-----------------------------------------------------

`True Status <https://community.smartthings.com/t/z-wave-switches-with-instant-update-2016/59328/7>`__
is a feature that allows end nodes to immediately report changes in their
status, especially when it is locally initiated. It has been covered by
`patents for years <https://community.smartthings.com/t/z-wave-switches-with-instant-update-2016/59328>`__
, but at least `one patent <https://patents.google.com/patent/US5905442A/en>`__)
expired in 2016. This feature MUST be leveraged and exposed to the IoT Service
in the Unify design, if the PAN nodes support it.

Status updates must be advertised to IoT Service as described in the
:ref:`unify_specifications_section_reportable_unsolicited_messages_from_the_pan`.

Rules Engines
-------------

Rules engines allow certain actions to be published when certain other events
are received. Rules Engines should be distributed, in the sense that
multiple IoT Services should be able to set up rules without conflicting
with each other. For this, a single Rules Engine Module should be provided
that manages a namespace likg ucl/rules_engine/ and providing an API for
setting, getting and modifying if-then-else style rules.

The Rules Engine SHOULD be implemented as a separate MQTT client to keep the
Broker simple.

Data Logging
------------

A data logger is an MQTT client that subscribes to
``ucl/by-unid/+/+/<CLUSTER-TO-LOG>/#`` and logs the received messages
somewhere. Multiple subscriptions and logging streams are possible.

Command-Line Interface
----------------------

It must be possible to control PAN devices and IoT Services from a Command-line
interface. The CLI must allow SQA to test Protocol Controllers or IoT Services
in isolation by injecting test stimulus to the broker. The CLI MUST also
allow Gateway manufacturers to initiate RF performance tests.

Data Caching or Status Database
-------------------------------

A cache of recent status messages from the PAN SHOULD be maintained in the
GW to reduce the load on the PAN network when facing repeated queries from
the IoT Service. This Data Layer can be thought of as a continually updating
database of the total PAN state. Ideally, IoT Services should query this
self-refreshing Status Database, and never issue requests directly to the PAN.
The subscriptions may need a mechanism to signal the desired freshness of the
response, so the Data Caching component can decide to update the status before
responding. Data caching should probably be handled in each Protocol Controller.
The mechanism of distribution (Retained Messages in the MQTT broker) or a real
database will be decided later. A replication mechanism between these data bases
will allow multiple Unified Gateways to control the same PAN without multiplying
the amount of probing traffic needed to keep their individual status data bases
up to date.

Latency Considerations
----------------------

Unify must provide a perceived "latency-free" end-user experience.
Lights and other devices should appear to respond immediately regardless of
the type of Unify configuration (local MQTT broker, slim MQTT broker in
cloud, full security with TLS for all broker connections, and so on).
In practice, this requires a latency below 250 ms, which should be
achievable given the following latency budget (all times are round-trips):

* Local Wi-Fi: 20-50 ms
* Local TLS processing 2 ms
* cloud connectivity including TLS: 20 ms
* cloud response time 20 ms
* PHY latency: 100 ms
* TOTAL: < 200 ms

Care must be taken in the Protocol Controller to avoid extra processing
delays when translating and communicating with the PHY Radio.

Examples and Use Cases
----------------------

Turning On a Zigbee Light Bulb from AWS IoT
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Assume the Zigbee Protocol Controller has the prefix "zb" and the bulb has
EUI-64 0x9876543210abcdef. The Protocol Controller has assigned the UNID
"zb-9876543210abcdef" to the bulb.

1. Unify GW starts up.
2. Zigbee Protocol Controller initializes, connects to the NCP, and discovers the
   Zigbee PAN devices. It also probes which clusters the light bulb supports. For
   simplicity, assume that only the Level and basic clusters are supported.
   The Level cluster is trivially translated to UCL as Level cluster (same data
   model in UCL and Zigbee makes this easy). The Protocol Controller publishes
   the following Retained Message to allow service discovery:
   ``ucl/by-unid/zb-9876543210abcdef/ep0/Level/SupportedCommands`` payload:
   ``{ "value" ["MoveToLevel", "Move", "Step", "Stop", "MoveToLevelWwithOnOff"] }``.
3. The Zigbee Protocol Controller subscribes to the following topics so it
   can execute commands in the cluster:

   * ``ucl/by-unid/zb-9876543210abcdef/ep0/OnOff/Commands/WriteAttributes``
   * ``ucl/by-unid/zb-9876543210abcdef/ep0/OnOff/Commands/ForceReadAttributes``
   * and one for each command in the LevelCluster: .../Move, .../MoveToLevelWithOnOff) etc.

4. The AWS-IoT IoT Service wants to display all devices that can be dimmed and
   turn on the first one. It connects to the Unify Broker and subscribes to
   ucl/by-unid/+/+/LevelCluster and receives the message described above. It now
   knows that UNID zb-9876543210abcdef Supports the Level cluster and can be
   dimmed.
5. To learn the type IoT device, the AWS-IoT IoT Service subscribes to
   ucl/by-type/dimmable_light/+ and receives a message back on the topic
   ucl/by-type/dimmable_light/zb-9876543210abcdef and knows that this is indeed
   a light.
6. The home owner's Alexa Smartphone App now displays the light bulb
   complete with a colorful bulb icon. The home owner
   clicks the "ON" button.
7. In a matter of milliseconds, the AWS-IoT IoT Service receives a command from
   the cloud to turn on the bulb. The IoT Service quickly translates this into
   UCL and publishes to the topic
   ``ucl/by-unid/zb-9876543210abcdef/ep0/Level/Commands/MoveToLevelWithOnOff``
   with a payload = ``{"Level":"100", "TransitionTime" : 5, ...}``
8. The Zigbee Protocol Controller receives this message, matches the prefix and
   translates the UCL message to a sequence of Zigbee Cluster Library Commands
   (maybe just one command) and sends those out over the NCP.
9. The bulb turns on.

Updating the Firmware of a PIR Sensor from the Cloud
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**Use case 1: Cloud service wants a fleet overview: A list of devices and
their Firmware Versions**.

Refer to :ref:`unify_specifications_chapter_common_ota`.

**Use case 2: A cloud user wants to firmware update a Unify-managed device**.

Refer to :ref:`unify_specifications_chapter_common_ota`.

Multicasting to Two Light Bulbs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**Use case: A IoT Service wants to turn on two light bulbs simultaneously**.

Assume that the UNIDs (UNID1 and UNID2) have already been discovered.

1. Unify GW starts up and Protocol Controller initializes.
2. Protocol Controller subscribes to ``ucl/by-unid/+/+/Groups/Attributes/#`` and
   ``ucl/by-unid/+/+/Groups/SupportedCommands``.
3. IoT Service uses the Groups cluster on UNID1/ep0 and UNID2/ep0 to add both
   UNIDs to the same group 1.
4. Protocol Controller receives the Groups commands via the subscription and
   adds UNID1/ep0 and UNID2/ep0 in group 1.
5. IoT Services reads the common capabilities of the group at
   ucl/by-group/1/+/SupportedCommands.
6. IoT Service publishes a command for the group. For example,
   ``{"Level:100", "TransitionTime":5}`` to topic
   ``ucl/by-group/1/Level/Commands/MoveToLevelWithOnOff``.
7. Protocol Controller receives the message and issues a multicast message to
   those nodes. If managed by two different Protocol Controllers, a singlecast
   on each PHY will happen instead.

Contractor Writing an IoT Service
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**Type 1: Cloud provider uses MQTT**

Assume that a contractor is commissioned to build an IoT service.
The IoT service connects UCL to a cloud solution of some sort. The contractor
picks a MQTT client in a preferred language (in this use case Python),
subscribes to relevant channels on the Unify broker, and publishes
translated-to-cloud-solution commands to the cloud solution and vice-verse.

Translation should be a lot simpler than the Protocol Controllers due to
structural similarities btw. UCL and prevalent IoT cloud solution architectures.
For example, both AWS IoT and Azure IoT uses MQTT transport and fits in this
category (AWS IoT is agnostic to the payload/data model, but UCL must be
translated to the data model of the cloud service being targeted, so some
translation is still needed).

**Type 2: Cloud provider does not use MQTT:**

Add MQTT client, subscribe to stuff on the GW broker, translate and transmit
