# Getting Started with Unify

## Introduction

Unify SDK is a software framework that simplifies the developer experience, removing difficult parts of network control and network management as it relates to gateway and hub development in IoT applications. It is extended to support Z-Wave protocol using [Z-Wave Protocol Controller](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/z-wave-protocol-controller). [Matter Bridge](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/unify-matter-bridge) serves as a reference IoT service, providing the capability to connect Matter to protocols that do not natively run .

## Prerequisites

- An RPi4 preinstalled with [Raspberry Pi OS Linux Version 12, Bookworm 64-bit](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2024-03-15/)


The following are the ways to get started with Unify..

1) Use [Portable Runtime](portable_runtime/readme_user.md)
for quick demo with Unify IoT gateway running on Windows, MacOS or Linux desktop.
