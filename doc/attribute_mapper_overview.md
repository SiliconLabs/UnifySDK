# Unify Attribute Mapper Overview

## Introduction

In the UnifySDK, Attribute Mapper is a component that offers a text file based system
that allows to define Attribute relations, allowing automatic rules and
attribute manipulations using assignments based on text script files.

Attribute Mapper during the Initialization phase, loads the UAM files for the given path and
parses the UAM files into AST trees and then evaluates the assignments, and creates dependencies.

## Attribute Mapper Components

  | Component | Description |
  |-----------|-------------|
  | Attribute_mapper_process |  This component is based on the Contiki process model and helps the mapper in arbitrating when to make calculations based on attribute updates.|

## Attribute Mapper Process

This Contiki process gets the events from the attribute store, like desired or reported attribute updates.
This process also checks whether the mapping is paused or allowed and, based on that, processes the update and sends it to the attribute mapper engine.
In general, the attribute updates are queued for processing, but attribute Creation and deletion are processed immediately.

## Attribute Mapper Engine

The purpose of the mapping engine is to define relations between attributes in the
attribute store. In general used to define relations from UCL (which is ZCL based) attributes to stack based attributes and vice versa. The actions performed by the mapping engine are quite
similar to the actions performed by a compiler. A compiler parses a text
document and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST). The AST is then optimized
and the AST nodes are translated into machine opcodes. In the attribute
mapper, we are not translating AST nodes to opcodes but instead, we are keeping
the AST in memory. The mapping engine only interacts with the attribute store.

The mapping engine uses several C++ classes to perform its tasks.

  1) The ast::UAMGrammar class defines how we translate a text document into our ast using the boost spirit framework.
  2) The ast::dep_eval class is used to build a graph of relations between attributes.
  3) ast::eval class is used to evaluate expressions when a change in an attribute value occurs

When an attribute is updated, the mapper engine gets the destination for the attribute and then gets a list of assignments based on the destination, and run assignments in below order

  1) The highest priority assignment if the destination exists
  2) All of them from low to high priority if the destination does not exist

In Attribute Mapper, the three types of assignments are

  1) Instance assignment, which will verify if an attribute path with a certain value exists
  2) Clearance assignment, which will undefine a value respecting the scope priorities
  3) Regular assignment, which updates the value respecting the scope priorities

## Attribute Mapper Parser and Grammer

### Main Parser

  This parser is only used to parse the UAM files into AST structures.
  Actual parser logic is defined in attribute_mapper_grammar

### Skipper Parser

  This parser is used to parse whitespaces and comments.

### Main UAM Grammar

This is closely coupled with data types in the AST. This component acts as a grammar definition and does not in itself produce anything.But when used with the boost::qi:parse_phrase function a text document can be transformed into a AST data structure.
For details on how this works see:
(<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi/tutorials/employee___parsing_into_structs.html>)

Rules are used by the main parser. The tokens produced by the parser must be compatible with destination struct
Parser operators: (<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi/reference/operator.html>)

More details on UAM Grammer are described in [How to Write UAM files](../doc/how_to_write_uam_files.rst)

## Attribute Mapper AST

This component holds all the data structures into which the UAM files are parsed. Few of them are:

  1) ENUMS of operators, Operands and structures of Operations, Expression, and conditions.
  2) Attribute struct holds the Attribute Type and Attribute path <br>
      &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;r: reported,&nbsp; &nbsp; d: desired,&nbsp; &nbsp;e: exists
  3) Assignment Struct holds the Assignment type along with LHS and RHS <br>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 - regular,&nbsp; &nbsp;1 - instance,&nbsp; &nbsp;2 - clearance assignments
  4) They also hold built-in-functions
  5) They also hold the Scope settings, which help to set the Priority and define multiple rules for the same attribute in different priorities.

## Attribute Mapper Evaluators

The evaluator walks through the Abstract Syntax Tress. Usually, the evaluator is used to evaluate a top-level expression, but this can also be applied to other AST nodes.

The evaluation is done in a context such that all attribute paths will be evaluated relative to the context (a common parent node in the attribute store). The AST evaluator returns a std::optional because evaluation is not always possible if the needed attribute is not found within the context. If the evaluation context is an invalid attribute all evaluations involving an attribute will return no value.

The AST evaluators are implemented as a functor (a function object). So, it allows us to use the boost::apply_visitor, which can
evaluate the boost::variant objects using functors, through the operator() overloading. The use of the boost::apply_visitor is
boost::apply_visitor( functor, variant ), this will call the appropriateoperator() overloading for the data type in the variant.
See <https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/doc/html/boost/apply_visitor.html>  for further details.

### Dependency Evaluator

This evaluator goes through an AST starting with an expression and builds a list of attribute IDs that are used if the expression is to be evaluated. Note that this evaluator accumulates a list of dependencies. i.e. each instance of this class should only be used once. Otherwise, the result will be a combined set of dependencies for each expression this evaluator has been applied on.

### Attribute Path Evaluator

This evaluator values a full attribute path and returns the matching attribute store attribute for that attribute path in the context.

### Attribute Mapper Path Match Evaluator

Let's say you have an attribute and a common parent type. If you have to check if your attribute/common parent type could be matching the attribute path of an expression.

For example, a.b[0].c, cheks if these is an attribute of type c, with the parent of type b with value 0, and the grand-parent of type a, and the grand-grand parent of type "common_parent_type"

## Attribute Mapper Example

An example of a simple mapping is the relation between the ZigBee attribute OnOff.value and the Z-Wave attribute binary_switch.value, if desired OnOff.value is updated the binary_switch.value should be updated. The same applies to the reported
value in the reverse direction.

So in a meta-description, we could describe this behavior with the following:

  1) r'OnOff_Value = r'BinarySwitch_Value
  2) d'BinarySwitch_Value = d'OnOff_Value

This means when the reported value of BinarySwitch_Value changes we would like to update the reported value of OnOff_Value. We will also create the OnOff_Value if it does not exist (this will only happen with reported values).
For the desired value we update BinarySwitch_Value if OnOff_Value changes.

The AST of the rule set is stored in memory because when an attribute changes, we should locate dependencies using the AST. The value of each AST node can be calculated in the context of an attribute node. Let's look at the example where an attribute is updated and the node type of that attribute is a leaf node in the AST. Then we need to try to re-calculate the value of all AST nodes that depends on the updated node. The update may lead to the writing of another attribute. In the example above an update leads to an update of the OnOff value. There could be cases where some node in the AST cannot be evaluated in a given context, for example, if one attribute depends on two other attributes but only one of them is defined. Then the AST will not be fully evaluated in the given context (the node does not support all the required command classes). In this case, the update will not lead to an attribute write.

### Example of Multiple Mappings in UAM

Let's take a fictive example of some ZigBee LED color command class. On the Zigbee side colors are defined as RGBW on the Z-Wave side the color may be in RGBW or may be in just RGB.

A mapping could look like this

zbColorW = zwColor[W] or ((zwColor[R] + zwColor[G] + zwColor[B])*1000 ) / 3333

Here we would pursue the relation using zwColor[W] first if that is not possible we would fall back to ((zwColor[R] + zwColor[G] + zwColor[B])*1000) /3333

## AST Helper Components

### AST Complexity Counter

Complexity Counter helps in calculating the complexity by counting the number of nodes in the AST.

### AST Test Framework

This component helps us to test the rules and run tests for the AST trees.

### AST Printer

This component helps to print the operations and path in the AST

### AST Cyclic Dependency Checker

This component helps to identify any cyclic dependencies that are formed in the AST tree.
Note: At present, this feature is disabled due to incomplete functionality.

### AST Reducer

AST evaluator which outputs a copy of the ast in reduced form. AST reducer works by going through the AST and trying to evaluate operands with a normal value evaluator which has an undefined context. This means that the evaluator will only succeed if the operand is a constant, it does not depend on an attribute
Note: At present, this feature is disabled due to incomplete functionality.

## Example Mapping between Z-Wave and DotDot

To establish a map that reports data on DotDot, we usually need to set
reported value of the DotDot attribute to match the reported value or the
Z-Wave Attribute.

DotDot attributes, once set, are detected and published automatically on MQTT.
This map will for example publish an OnOff attribute for a Binary Switch
value.

```bash
  // Binary switch Command Class
  def zwCOMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY_VERSION 0x2501
  def zwSWITCH_BINARY_STATE 0x2502
  def zwSWITCH_BINARY_VALUE 0x2503

  // OnOff Cluster
  def zbON_OFF_CLUSTER_SWITCH 0x00060000

  scope 0 {
  // Linking reported attributes zwave -> zigbee
  r'zbON_OFF_CLUSTER_SWITCH = r'zwSWITCH_BINARY_STATE.zwSWITCH_BINARY_VALUE
```

Given that, only the reported is mapped, if an MQTT client tries to set the
DotDot OnOff attribute with a command, nothing will happen on the Z-Wave
side.

To make Z-Wave value updates based on DotDot commands, the desired value
change of a dotdot attribute should be mapped to an update of the desired
Z-Wave value:

```bash
  // Linking desired attributes zigbee -> zwave
  d'zwSWITCH_BINARY_STATE.zwSWITCH_BINARY_VALUE = d'zbON_OFF_CLUSTER_SWITCH
```
