# UPTI CAP User's Guide

UPTI CAP is acronym for Unify Packet Trace Interface Capture

***NOTE*** To make UPTI CAP work, Silicon Labs WSTK adapters needs a special PTI enabled firmware and must be connected to a LAN via Ethernet.

## Description

The *UPTI_CAP* is an application to communicate with Silicon Labs WSTK
adapters, to capture data from adapters debug channel and to publish captured
data as MQTT messages.

The types of data depend from application loaded on wireless SoC and debug adapter
(it can includes energy consumption data, network packet data or any other data
available over the debug channel).

On startup, *UPTI_CAP* automatically discovers and publish lists of debug adapters
that are connected to the local subnet. You can also configure *UPTI_CAP* to discover
debug adapters on other subnets by providing the IP adressess list as the command line argument.
Adapters discovery can be started by publishing empty JSON to `ucl/UPTICap/Discover` topic.

At discovery phase, application sends UDP broadcast packets to port 19020 on
all network interfaces (or/and to IP adressess list from command line arguments)
and waits for answers.

Application decodes answers (if any), identifies serial numbers, IP adresses
and publishes list of supported devices to `ucl/UPTICap/List` topic.

At capturing phase, application establishes TCP connection to port 4095 of
adapter (debug channel), identifies debug messages in TCP stream, tries to parse
messages and publishes trace packages to `ucl/UPTICap/<SerialNumber>/TracePackage` topic.

Application allows to capture data from several adapters simultaneously.
Capture/parse/publish task for each adapter runs as thread.

Capturing and publishing data from debug channel is disabled by default.

To start/stop capturing data and publishing trace packages an IoT Service MUST
publish control message to `ucl/UPTICap/<SerialNumber>/Toggle` topic.

### Using DevGUI

Dev GUI application allows user to initiate adapters discovery,
to start/stop trace packages capturing and visualize trace packages.

* Enable/Disable PTI on the Protocol Controller
    To `Enable` or `Disable` the PTI functionality for controllers with NCP that support this, you need to toggle `On\Off PTI` switch to the desired position on the `RFTelemetry` page
    ![ToggleSerialApiPTI](assets/enable_serial_api_pti.png).
    Note: An enabled pti produces a large number of messages sent via mqtt, so to prevent mqtt overload it is recommended to keep PTI disabled at all times while not in use.
    Note: This functionality is available when running the [ZPC](../zpc/readme_user.md).

* Discovery PTI
    To discover the network and identify all PTIs, press `Discovery` button on the `UPTI` page. After some time, all PTIs will be available in a table with information about `Serial Number`, `IP Address` and connection status
    ![Discovery](assets/discover.png).

* Enable/Disable data capture
    To `Toggle` capturing data, press `Enable` or `Disable` button. If you `Enable` capturing, you can choose in the pop-up window whether you want to parse additional data or only capture raw data.

    ![EnabledPTI](assets/enabled_pti.png)

* View Trace Package
    To view a list of trace packages press the `View Trace` button.
    You will see the table of captured trace packages with additional data:

    ![WithAdditionalData](assets/with_additional_data.png)

    or without additional data:

## Installation

For installing please refer to the general installation method in
[Getting started](../../doc/getting_started.md).

## Running the UPTI CAP

### Using Systemd Service

The best way to run the UPTI CAP is using the Systemd service that is installed with

the Debian installer. For more information, see the
[Unify Framework User guide](../../doc/unify_readme_user.md).

### Using Command Line

Alternatively, you can run the UPTICAP by executing `uic-upti-cap`.
You can configure the MQTT server, database path, through command line options.
For details about options, run `uic-upti-cap --help` command:

Make sure that you do not run the UPTICAP both as a service and using the
command line.

```console
pi@uic-upti-cap:~ $ service uic-upti-cap status
● uic-upti-cap.service - Unified IoT UPTI cap
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/uic-upti-cap.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2021-11-04 11:38:32 EET; 17min ago
 Main PID: 1506 (uic-upti-cap)
    Tasks: 3 (limit: 4915)
   CGroup: /system.slice/uic-upti-cap.service
           └─1506 /usr/bin/uic-upti-cap
```

If the service is running, stop it using the following command before
you run the application manually:

```console
pi@unify:~ $ service uic-upti-cap stop
```
