 * @defgroup s2incl S2 inclusion
 * Hooks to start the S2 inclusion state machine. This state machine will handle both
 * add mode and learn mode.
 *
 * The upper layers must be able to act on certain events during inclusion.
 *
 * When in learn mode
 * the upper layer must accept the DSK of the controller. A node may choose to present the DSK
 * on a display to allow the user to verify the including controller.
 *
 * When in add mode, the controller must accept the requested keys as well as the DSK of the
 * joining node.
