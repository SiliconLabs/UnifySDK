\mainpage libs2 API Guide
libs2 is an library which implements all functionality related to Z-Wave S2 security. libs2 is deviced into 4 major components. 
Z-Wave S2 security is extensively described in SDS11274. 

\li \ref crypto functions, both raw aes modules, eliptic curve functions and higher level functions, such a random number generator, key 
derivation functions and streaming functions such as AESCCM.
\li \ref S2trans functions. Responsible for frame exchange during normal S2 communication.
\li \ref s2incl functions. These function are responsible for secure key exchange during inclusion. This is the module which used the ECDH functions.
\li \ref keystore functions. These are not really implemented by libs2, but is an abstract description of functions needed by libs2 to 
store ECDH keys and network keys.
 
 
\section integration Integrating libs2

This section describes how in integrate libs2 into a existing Z-Wave application. Throughout this section we will refer to 
sections of the Z/IP Gateway source code. The Z/IP Gateway is a Z-Wave reference implementation that uses libs2. In the 
Z/IP Gateway, the important places to look is the source file S2_wrap.c and CC_Networkmanagement.c.

\subsection tran_int Transport Layer Integration

To get started an application using libs2 must implement the functions defined in \ref s2external. In the Z/IP Gateway 
these are all implemented in S2_wrap.c.

Fist we will describe all the calls from libs2 and upward to your application.

First the functions \ref S2_send_frame and \ref S2_send_frame_multi must be implemented. These function maps directly to ZW_SendData or
ZW_SendDataBridge if a bridge library is used. When sending is done, the S2 layer need to be notified using the
function \ref S2_send_frame_done_notify.

An implementations may look like this:

\code

static void S2_send_frame_callback(BYTE txStatus) {
  S2_send_frame_done_notify((struct S2*) user,
      txStatus == TRANSMIT_COMPLETE_OK ? S2_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE_OK : S2_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE_NO_ACK,
          clock_time()-transmit_start_time + NONCE_REP_TIME);
}

uint8_t S2_send_frame(struct S2* ctxt,const s2_connection_t* conn, uint8_t* buf, uint16_t len) {

   return ZW_SendData(conn->r_node,
                (BYTE*) buf,
                len,
                conn->zw_tx_options, S2_send_frame_callback);
}                

uint8_t S2_send_frame_multi(struct S2* ctxt,const s2_connection_t* conn, uint8_t* buf, uint16_t len) {
   transmit_start_time = clock_time();
   return ZW_SendData(0xFF,
                (BYTE*) buf,
                len,
                conn->zw_tx_options, S2_send_frame_callback);
}                

\endcode

 The next thing is a timer the function \ref S2_set_timeout must start a timer and then call 
 \ref S2_timeout_notify on timeout.
 
\code
static void timeout() {
  S2_timeout_notify(ctxt);
}

void S2_set_timeout(struct S2* ctxt, uint32_t interval) {
  ZW_TimerStart(interval/10, timeout,TIMER_ONE_TIME)
} 
\endcode
 
 
Now we need to interface a HW random number generator. Make sure that this a hardware seeded random number.

\code
S2_get_hw_random(
  uint8_t *buf,
  uint8_t len)
{
  uint8_t *pbuf;
  uint8_t rnd[2];
  uint8_t left, pos;

  pbuf = buf;
  left = len;
  while (left > 0)
  {
    ZW_GetRandomWord(rnd);    
    *pbuf++ = *rnd;
    left--;
    if (left > 0)
    {
      *pbuf++ = *(rnd + 1);
      left--;
    }
  }
}
\endcode

We also need to setup command list, which is sent in the S2 commands supported get. This is the "S2 NIF". 

\code
void S2_get_commands_supported(uint8_t class_id, uint8_t** cmdClasses, uint8_t* length) {
  *cmdClasses = &SecureClasses[0];
  *length  = nSecureClasses;
}
\endcode

Finally what to do when a S2 frame has been received:

\code
void S2_msg_received_event(struct S2* ctxt,s2_connection_t* src , uint8_t* buf, uint16_t len) {
  ts_param_t p;
  const int scheme_map[] = {
      SECURITY_SCHEME_2_UNAUTHENTICATED,
      SECURITY_SCHEME_2_AUTHENTICATED,
      SECURITY_SCHEME_2_ACCESS};
  ts_set_std(&p,0);


  p.scheme = scheme_map[src->class_id];
  p.snode = src->r_node;
  p.dnode = src->l_node;

  ApplicationCommandHandlerZIP(&p,(ZW_APPLICATION_TX_BUFFER*)buf,len);
}
\endcode

This was all the functions which are calling upward. Now we cover all the functions calling downward. Ie, from you
application into libs2.

On application boot fist thing to do is to initiate the S2 context. This is done with \ref S2_init_ctx. This must be done on application startup and when the
homeid changes. In this example we also check if the context has already been initialized.
\code
 if(s2_ctx) S2_destroy(s2_ctx);
 s2_ctx = S2_init_ctx(UIP_HTONL(homeID));
\endcode

The function S2_init_ctx will also read the keys from the keystore, and initialize the prng.

When the application receives a COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY2 frame, it must call the \ref S2_application_command_handler. It is important 
that the \ref S2_RXOPTION_MULTICAST is set when receiving multicast or broadcast frame.

\code
security2_CommandHandler(ts_param_t* p,
const ZW_APPLICATION_TX_BUFFER *pCmd, uint16_t cmdLength) /* IN Number of command bytes including the command */
{
  const uint8_t s2_cap_report[] = {COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY_2, SECURITY_2_CAPABILITIES_REPORT,0};

  s2_connection_t conn;
  conn.r_node = p->snode;
  conn.l_node = p->dnode;
  conn.zw_tx_options = p->tx_flags;
  conn.rx_options = 0;

  conn.tx_options = p->rx_flags & ( RECEIVE_STATUS_TYPE_BROAD |  RECEIVE_STATUS_TYPE_MULTI) ? S2_RXOPTION_MULTICAST : 0;

  if( (pCmd->ZW_Common.cmd == SECURITY_2_CONTROLLER_CAPABILITIES_GET)  && (p->scheme == SECURITY_SCHEME_2_ACCESS)) {
    S2_send_data(s2_ctx,&conn,s2_cap_report,sizeof(s2_cap_report));
  } else {
    S2_application_command_handler(s2_ctx,&conn,(uint8_t*) pCmd,cmdLength);
  }
}
\endcode

\subsection single_trans Singlecast frame transmission.
When the application needs to send a S2 singlecast frame it just calls \ref S2_send_data. It is important to select the desired security class. 
And also which verification strategy to use when sending. See \ref S2_TXOPTION_VERIFY_DELIVERY. When frame transmission has completed 
libs2 will call the function \ref S2_send_done_event.

\subsection multicst_trans Multicast frame transmission
When sending multicast frames the application needs to go though multiple steps.

\li A group id must be selected. A group id is just a byte representing the group of nodes the multicast frame is destened for. 
It is the application which is responsible for mapping multicast node lists and multicast group ids.

\li Then the application sends a S2 multi cast frame with \ref S2_send_data_multicast here the r_node must be set to the group id.
\li Then the application must send a singlecast folloup message to the first node in the node list. Here the application will
set \ref S2_TXOPTION_SINGLECAST_FOLLOWUP, \ref S2_TXOPTION_VERIFY_DELIVERY and \ref S2_TXOPTION_FIRST_SINGLECAST_FOLLOWUP. 
\li now the application may sync up the next nodes, but this time it must only set \ref S2_TXOPTION_SINGLECAST_FOLLOWUP, \ref S2_TXOPTION_VERIFY_DELIVERY 
\li the last step must be repeated for the rest of the nodes.

\subsection key_int  Keystore Layer Integration
Here we must interface routines which stores the network and ECDH keys to a file or flash storange. In the Z/IP Gateway this is
implemented in s2_keystore.c.
Integration of this should be straight forward. See \ref keystore.
 
Notice on the ECDH keypair generations. The private EDCH key may just be any 128 random number. The public ECDH key may be generated 
from the private key using the funciton \ref crypto_scalarmult_curve25519_base. This means that in reality the application only needs
to actually store the private ECDH key.

The function \ref keystore_public_key_read, may be implemented like this:

\code
void
keystore_public_key_read(uint8_t *pub_key)
{
  uint8_t priv_key[32];
  keystore_private_key_read(priv_key);
  crypto_scalarmult_curve25519_base(pub_key,priv_key);
  memset(priv_key,0,sizeof(priv_key));
} 
\endcode

\subsection incl_int Inclusion Layer Integration
The inclusion layer integration, mainly require the application to setup an event
handler which need to act on cirtan events. There is also a timer associated 
with the inclusion module. The functions related to the inclusion module is 
described in \ref s2incl. In the Z/IP Gateway these functions are referred
in S2_wrap.c.


In S2 incluison the application user need to verify the identity as well as the
security level of a node being included. When a controller or slave is being 
included into a network the user may optionally verify the including controler.

This means that the appliction needs to handle user inteaction durring inclusion.

Fist the application must initailise the inclusion layer on boot, and setup the
event handler, see \ref incl_event_handler.
\code
  s2_inclusion_init(SECURITY_2_SCHEME_1_SUPPORT,KEX_REPORT_CURVE_25519,
      SECURITY_2_SECURITY_2_CLASS_0|SECURITY_2_SECURITY_2_CLASS_1 | SECURITY_2_SECURITY_2_CLASS_2 | SECURITY_2_SECURITY_0_NETWORK_KEY);
  s2_inclusion_set_event_handler(&sec2_event_handler);
\endcode

\subsection incl_event_handler Setting up the user libs2 inclusion event handler. 
The event handler is registered into libs2 using the function \ref s2_inclusion_set_event_handler.
The events that must be handled by the event handler is described in \ref zwave_event_codes_t.

This is an example of an event handler
\code
static void sec2_event_handler(zwave_event_t* ev) {
  uint8_t flags;
  switch(ev->event_type) {
    case S2_NODE_INCLUSION_INITIATED_EVENT:
      sec0_abort_inclusion(); //Here we abort S0 inclusion
      break;
    case S2_NODE_INCLUSION_PUBLIC_KEY_CHALLENGE_EVENT:
      /* Here we ask the user to verify the public key */
      NetworkManagement_dsk_challenge(ev->evt.s2_event.s2_data.challenge_req.public_key);
      break;
    case S2_NODE_INCLUSION_KEX_REPORT_EVENT:
      /* Here we ask the user to verify that the node is allowed to get the security classes it has asked for*/
      NetworkManagement_key_request(ev->evt.s2_event.s2_data.kex_report.security_keys);
      break;
    case S2_NODE_INCLUSION_COMPLETE_EVENT:
      /* The new node has been S2 included */
      if(sec_incl_cb) {
        sec_incl_cb(keystore_flags_2_node_flags(ev->evt.s2_event.s2_data.inclusion_complete.exchanged_keys));
      }
      break;
    case S2_NODE_JOINING_COMPLETE_EVENT:
      /* The controller has now been included. Here we ask the keystore which keys has been granted.*/
      nvm_config_get(assigned_keys,&flags);
      if(sec_incl_cb) {
        sec_incl_cb(keystore_flags_2_node_flags(flags));
      }
      break;
    case S2_NODE_INCLUSION_FAILED_EVENT:
      /* We have failed to S2 include the new node, or failed to be included ourselevs */
      if(sec_incl_cb) {
        sec_incl_cb(NODE_FLAG_KNOWN_BAD | (ev->evt.s2_event.s2_data.inclusion_fail.kex_fail_type << 16));
      }
      break;
    case S2_JOINING_COMPLETE_NEVER_STARTED_EVENT:
      /* The S2 bootstrapping never started. If this was a SmartStart learn mode, we must
       * self-destruct now. */
      if(is_smart_start_learn_mode) {
        do_self_destruct();
      }
      break;
  }
}
\endcode
In the example above NetworkManagement_key_request, will ask the user if the device is allowed to get the S2 
keys which it has asked for. There is not requirement for user interaction in this step. The controller
may choose just to call \ref s2_inclusion_key_grant with the same keys as requested.

In addition NetworkManagement_dsk_challenge will ask the user to verify the public key. Please not that for
S2 access class devices ev->evt.s2_event.s2_data.challenge_req.public_key will not contain the first two bytes of
the DSK. These two bytes must be entered by the user. Then the user has verified the DSK (and optionally typed in 
two bytes), \ref s2_inclusion_challenge_response must be called.

The S2_JOINING_COMPLETE_NEVER_STARTED_EVENT is emitted when the S2 bootstrapping never started.
If the device is a controller and is adding another device, this event can be safely ignored. A device
in classic learn mode can also ignore this event. This event is only important for devices which have just 
completed a Smart Start learn mode - they must initiate a self-destruct when receiving upon receiving the event.
Smart Start included devices receiving the S2_NODE_INCLUSION_FAILED_EVENT must also self-destruct. In the example
above, this happens in sec_incl_cb().

\subsection incl_timer Inclusion timer.
Setting the inclusion timer(\ref s2_inclusion_set_timeout) is straight forward.

\code 
static void incl_timeout(void* ctxt) {
  s2_inclusion_notify_timeout((struct S2*)ctxt);
}

uint8_t s2_inclusion_set_timeout(struct S2* ctxt, uint32_t interval) {
  ctimer_set(&s2_inclusion_timer,interval * 10,incl_timeout,ctxt);
  return 0;
}
\endcode

\subsection do_inclusion Perfoming a inclusion or learnmode.
The two relevant functions are \ref s2_inclusion_including_start and \ref s2_inclusion_joining_start which should be 
executed right after the Z-Wave protocol inclusion is done.
