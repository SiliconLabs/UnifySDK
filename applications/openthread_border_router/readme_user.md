# OpenThread Border Router User Guide

The OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) is included in a binary Debian package
with the Unify Host SDK. The version included is compiled from the GSDK
with CPCd connectivity and multiprotocol capabilities enabled.
It communicates to the 802.15.4 RCP using SPINEL via CPCd.
It can run alongside zigbeed using the same RCP, provided both
networks use the same 802.15.4 channel.

To get started running OTBR with CPCd, see the
[Multiprotocol Setup](../../doc/getting_started_multiprotocol_cpc.md) page.
