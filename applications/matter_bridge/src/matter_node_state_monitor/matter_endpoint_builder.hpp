 * builder<chip::EmberAfAttributeMetadata> in order to build matter attributes
 * and subsequently matter clusters.
 *
 * When all clusters and attributes are added, the final context attribute can
 * be retrieved by calling `build_and_get()`.
 * 
 * Since a EmberAfEndpointType contains pointers to arrays of clusters and attributes,
 * we need to guarantee that these arrays can never life shorter as the EmberAfEndpointType
 * structure itself. The context object therefore holds lifetime references to these arrays
 * to satisfy this requirement. Only the whole context can be removed or added.
 * this way the lifetime of EmberAfEndpointType equals the life time of the arrays
 * its referencing.
