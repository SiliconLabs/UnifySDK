    * The purpose of the cluster translator is to handle read/write attribute
    * calls as well as matter commands. Since the matter data model and the UIC
    * data model are very similar we will generally be able to do a 1-1
    * translation.
    *
    * The translator has a ZAP generated handler, which implements a generic
    * handler for all clusters which is able to send translate Matter commands
    * into mqtt messages. The translator uses
    * `InteractionModelEngine::RegisterCommandHandler` to register itself with
    * the matter application framework. As the default behavior the translator
    * will directly translate the matter command into a unify mqtt command.
    *
    * The translator will also handle attribute read and attribute writes. For
    * attributes the translator uses the system
    * `registerAttributeAccessOverride, when an attribute read is requested the
    * Unify Reported value should be reported when an attribute write is
    * requested the corresponding /WriteAttribute command is published on the
    * mqtt side.
    *
    * The Unify Cluster translator is not required to check the capabilities of
    * a node before sending WriteAttributes or other commands.
