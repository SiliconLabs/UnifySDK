<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The Unify Framework delivers a unified high-level API, such as cloud control,
local HomeAssistant middle-wares, and so on to control, observe and manage
end nodes in all PHYs supported by Silicon Labs. It also facilitates code
reuse and allows easily adding new high-level APIs without the need to modify
the PHY drivers. After a new high-level API module has been created, it should
be possible to control all the supported PHYs without any changes to the PHY
drivers. Likewise, after a new PHY driver has been created, it should
immediately be possible to control that PHY from all the existing high-level
APIs without modifying the high-level API module.</p>
<p>In other words, the Unify Framework decouples API modules from the PHY drivers.</p>
<p>The Unify Framework is a software component that runs inside a gateway product.
It needs a hardware platform and an operating system to be a complete product.</p>

<p>From a business perspective, Unify makes it possible to maintain a single IoT
Service that can interface with multiple wireless PHY radios. The functionality
includes SmartStart, best-in-class security, firmware updates, and so on.
Unify makes it easier to develop gateway products by driving down the marginal
effort needed in launching the next customer gateway and enables rapid
development cycles.</p>
<p>The remainder of this document refers to PHY drivers as Protocol Controllers
because they not only drive the modem but also translate the Application
Layer commands from one PHY technology to another. Similarly, the high-level
API modules are called IoT Services, which are named after the expected use
case, but they can also connect to locally running services.</p>

<section id="system-components">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>System Components<a class="headerlink" href="#system-components" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The Unify Framework is a software component of a full plastic-enclosed GW box.
You can think of it as a “device driver” for the IoT, seen from the Host MCU
in the GW box. The Unify component uses MQTT as an internal message-bus for
inter-process communication among MQTT clients that are each an independent
process/thread. In a Linux or other full OS implementation, real processes
should be used. The primary hardware platform of the Unify design is a
Cortex A-class device or an equivalent.</p>
<p>The MQTT clients are one of these types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>IoT Services (or IoT services): These modules expose the externally-visible
APIs in Unify. IoT Services translate back and forth between external APIs
and the intermediate UCL. The external API is typically consumed by a
cloud-service or a local middleware/app. It is slightly confusing
that an IoT Service can also provide APIs to a locally-running service. It
is named after the expected use case, which is a cloud-based remote control.
Examples of IoT Services include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AWS IoT</p></li>
<li><p>Azure IoT</p></li>
<li><p>Rules Engines (even if running locally)</p></li>
<li><p>Web UI for local control</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Protocol Controllers: These MQTT clients own a physical radio operated
through Unify. They also translate from UCL to the native language of
the radio. Examples include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Z-Wave Protocol Controller owning a SerialAPI</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A singleton Resource Directory MQTT client, responsible for aggregating
node information and providing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/+/discover</span></code> topic for discovering
nodes, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> can be one of (by-unid, by-location, by-roletype,
by-devicetype, by-group).</p></li>
</ul>

MQTT as an integral part. IoT Services (blue boxes) for AWS IoT, Azure and so
on are shown. Z-Wave Protocol Controllers (green boxes) for Silicon Labs PHYs
are shown. All IoT Services and Protocol Controllers are connected by a common
Unify abstraction layer consisting of an MQTT broker transporting the Unify
Controller Language. Clients can roughly be grouped into IoT Services, local
middlewares, Protocol Controllers, and a Singleton Resource Directory.</p>
<p>The Resource Directory is also an MQTT client.</p>
<p>The MQTT server should run as a separate Linux process.</p>
<p>The Resource Directory facilitates device discovery and communicates with each
Protocol Controller through specific MQTT topics. The Protocol Controller MUST
automatically notify the Resource Directory of nodes that join or leave the
network, as well as multicast groups that are added/removed/modified.</p>
<section id="design-variants">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Design Variants<a class="headerlink" href="#design-variants" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Unify gateways comes in a few variants that differ in the number of PHYs
controlled:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A multi-homed Unify gateway has several Protocol Controllers installed.
This is a more complicated product to develop and market.</p></li>
<li><p>A single-homed Unify gateway has a single Protocol Controller and relies on MQTT
bridging and/or Cloud Services to connect to other PHYs. To unify two PHYs, you need
two physical Unify-based gateways, which must be connected to the same
IP network or cloud service. The two single-Protocol Controller Unify GWs
communicate via MQTT bridging and UCL or via a Cloud Service they are both
connected to. The single-homed Unify GW is a simpler product to develop, allows
the developer to focus solely on the PHY they are most comfortable with, and
still end up with a complete, functional, gateway product. The process of
interconnecting multiple independent single-Protocol Controller Unify GWs can be
thought of as the “LEGO-block design principle for Unify”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another variant of the design uses MQTT bridging to allow multiple Unify
gateways to cooperatively control and manage the same PAN. The bridging may
happen either locally or in the cloud.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.6. </span>Unify Controller Language Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#unify-controller-language-definition" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The Unify Controller Language (UCL) is developed to allow the easiest possible
translation to and from as many PHYs and cloud services as possible. The UCL
serves as an abstraction layer between the PHY-specific data models and the
models used in various Unify services for controlling IoT devices.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="Chapter13-unify-controller-language-data-model.html#unify-specifications-chapter-unify-controller-language-data-model"><span class="std std-ref">Unify Controller Language Data Model (Experimental)</span></a>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.7. </span>UNID: Unified Node IDs<a class="headerlink" href="#unid-unified-node-ids" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The UNIDs are unique text strings in the MQTT topic hierarchy, which MUST
follow the MQTT naming limitations.</p>
<p>The Protocol Controllers generate UNID for all nodes in the PAN (or PANs) it
controls. The UNID MUST consist of a prefix part and a PAN part, separated by a
minus string character “-“.</p>
<p>The PAN part MUST be generated by the Protocol Controller and MUST be unique
among PAN parts generated by that PC. The Protocol Controller MUST prefix all
UNIDs with the same prefix. This prefix must be configurable at startup. The
system integrator MUST ensure that no two Protocol Controllers have the same
prefix configured. The prefix ensures that separate Protocol Controllers never
generate the same UNID and hence keeps them unique.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#table-unify-specifications-unid-examples"><span class="std std-numref">Table 1.2</span></a> shows examples of generated
UNIDs:</p>

NodeID is mutable on network reset.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, Z-Wave UNIDs could be prefixed “zw”. The prefix should be short
(max 8-10 characters) to keep MQTT topics short.</p>
<p>The UNID PAN parts can be derived from a unique identifier, such as the EUI-64
of a Z-Wave device. For devices without a permanent unique identifier, something
like the currently assigned address on the PAN can be used, for example a
combination of HomeID and NodeID in Z-Wave.</p>
<p>Mutable UNID PAN parts may be used instead of permanent identifiers if they
allow simpler diagnostics and troubleshooting of the system. This may be
the case when choosing Z-Wave HomeID/NodeIDs instead of S2 DSKs. The
disadvantage is that nodes will change their UNID when the network is reset or
leaving and re-joining.</p>

levels and + matches one. As a result, subscribing to ucl/by-unid/# gets all
ACs for all PAN nodes. On the other hand, subscribing to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/+/+/DoorLock/#</span></code> receives only data related to Door Lock Cluster
functionality on any and all Door Locks in the network.</p>
<p>The topic tree looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ucl/

<h2><span class="section-number">1.11. </span>Protocol Controller and IoT Service MQTT Clients<a class="headerlink" href="#protocol-controller-and-iot-service-mqtt-clients" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The MQTT clients connecting to the MQTT broker of a Unify gateway can very
broadly be divided into two categories: Protocol Controllers and IoT Services.
These were also called PHY Translator/Connectors and Cloud
Connectors/Translators previously.</p>
<p>A Protocol Controller is an MQTT client that runs in its own OS process. It can
be written in any language and run on any platform that provides an MQTT client.</p>
<p>A Protocol Controller MUST implement these interfaces</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unify Interface. The interface between the MQTT Broker and each Protocol
Controller. This is an MQTT pub/sub connection, with topics and payloads
specified by the UCL.</p></li>
<li><p>PAN interface: NCP, SerialAPI or similar PHY-specific interface.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An IoT Service MUST implement this interface:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unify Interface. The interface between the MQTT Broker and each Protocol
Controller. This is an MQTT pub/sub connection with topics and payloads
specified by the UCL.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An IoT Service MAY implement this interface:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cloud Interface: Interface from Cloud Service to IoT Service module in the
Unify gateway. The first example is an AWS-IoT IoT Service module. Rules
Engines can also be seen as special instances of IoT Services. The Cloud
Interface is defined by the cloud service and implemented by the IoT Service.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="protocol-controller-api">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.11.1. </span>Protocol Controller API<a class="headerlink" href="#protocol-controller-api" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Each Protocol Controller connects to the MQTT server.
The Protocol Controller subscribes for example to an MQTT topic:</p>
<p>&gt; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/#</span></code></p>
<p>When packets are received, the Protocol Controller must drop all messages where
the UNID prefix does not match the manually-configured prefix of the Protocol
Controller. For example, the Z-Wave Protocol Controller may be manually
configured to handle all UNIDs starting with, for example, <cite>zw-example-pc-*</cite> prefix.
They will each drop everything with UNID not matching that prefix.</p>
<p>A Protocol Controller MUST publish a message to the topic
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/&lt;UNID&gt;/State</span></code> to notify the IoT Services of the new node.</p>
<p>It MUST also process and translate all commands from a topic
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/&lt;UNID&gt;/+/+</span></code> to the PAN (i.e., the PHY Radio it owns), if the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;UNID&gt;</span></code> matches the prefix assigned to the Protocol Controller. The Cluster
and Command is derived by the Protocol Controller from the wildcard part of the
received topic and translated to PAN-specific commands as the Protocol
Controller sees fit. The UCL header in the MQTT payload must also be examined as
part of the translation to the native language. The translation of one UCL
command MAY result in a sequence of PHY native commands. For example, one UCL command
may be translated to a sequence of Z-Wave commands and then transmitted through
the NCP.</p>
<p>When commands are received from the PAN, a Protocol Controller must translate
and publish to the MQTT topic
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/&lt;source_UNID&gt;/ep&lt;ID&gt;/&lt;ClusterName&gt;/Attributes/&lt;AttributeName&gt;/Reported</span></code>
with a UCL header and translated CMD payload in the MQTT payload field.
The Protocol Controller must fill out the UCL header fields in addition to
concatenating with the translated payload.</p>
<p>When commands are received from the PAN, a Protocol Controller may
additionally publish on the MQTT topic:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/&lt;source_UNID&gt;/ep&lt;ID&gt;/&lt;ClusterName&gt;/GeneratedCommands/&lt;CommandName&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="Chapter02-ZCL-in-uic.html#unify-specifications-chapter-zcl-in-unify-application-level-control"><span class="std std-ref">Dotdot ZCL in Unify Framework for Application Level Control</span></a>
for details.</p>
<p><strong>Protocol Controller responsibilities</strong>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Protocol Controller starts up and queries the current state of all PAN Nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure all PAN nodes to send updates to the NCP controller by the Protocol Controller.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever node state changes, publish to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/&lt;UNID&gt;/ep&lt;EndPointID&gt;/&lt;Cluster&gt;</span></code> for all UNIDs/EndPointIDs
in its PAN and for all Clusters supported. This allows IoT Services to
discover nodes and read out the state by subscribing to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/+/+/&lt;Cluster&gt;/#</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribe to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/#</span></code> and siphon off only the UNIDs assigned to
this Protocol Controller.</p></li>
<li><p>Translate Clusters, Commands/WriteAttributes and
Commands/ForceReadAttributes published to the node from UCL to the
native Application Layer language of the PAN. Finally, transmit the
translated sequence of frames to the radio.</p></li>
<li><p>Handle multicast:</p></li>

<p>When creating IoT Service modules, the main goal is to keep this
interface simple and easy to implement correctly, securely, and robustly.</p>
<p>A cloud controller must implement an MQTT Client and TLS transport for the MQTT
connection. Unify abstracts away the differences between end-nodes on
different PHYs. The IoT Service can use a single unified API for all PHY types.
This is a primary goal of Unify.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>PHY-specific APIs MAY be added on demand, but a single API
covering all PHYs is strongly preferred. Of course, exceptions will arise over
the coming years as PHY technologies develop at break-neck pace and Unify may
as well be pragmatic about it. The UCL API is expected to develop with the PHY
technologies.</p>

<p>The Unify processes (Protocol Controllers, Resource Directory, IoT Services) MUST
be hardened against malformed input thorough input validation, for example, should
avoid common bug classes, such as array out-of-bounds addressing and pointer errors
by design. It is RECOMMENDED to use memory safe languages (not C/C++). The
processes SHOULD adopt the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privileges</a>,
and not require root privileges to run. If a root is required, the processes
SHOULD drop the privileges after initialization. A similar hardening SHOULD be
applied to the MQTT Broker, although this will probably be a third-party
implementation, at least in the first several phases of the Unify project.</p>
<p>The Protocol Controller and Resource Directory processes handle sensitive crypto
key material (at least the certificates and private keys for establishing TLS
session with MQTT broker, potentially also PAN network keys). PAN encryption
keys SHOULD (MUST in later phase) be stored in the PHY radio chip whenever
possible to protect from adversarial processes on the Unify GW itself.
Therefore, it must be protected against hostile processes reading the memory of
the Unify software. Similarly, the Unify software must have exclusive access to
the radios, so hostile processes cannot inject commands into the PAN. This must
be achieved through OS access control mechanisms.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.15.1. </span>Z-Wave Battery Device<a class="headerlink" href="#z-wave-battery-device" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Z-Wave Protocol Controllers must handle messages to Sleepy Devices,
which are known as Battery Devices or devices implementing the
Wake Up Command Class, in the following way:</p>
<p>Whenever a Battery Device is included in the PAN, the Protocol Controller
MUST set itself as the Lifeline of that node (if allowed) (i.e., make the node
report all status commands to the Protocol Controller). The Battery Node
will send Wake Up Notification Commands to the Protocol Controller whenever
it is available for two-way communication.
Usually the frequency is selected to achieve a certain battery life.</p>
<p>After a message for a particular battery device has been published, and again
when the message has been delivered and acknowledged on the application layer,
the Protocol Controller must publish attribute state updates to their
respective topics
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-unid/&lt;UNID&gt;/ep&lt;EndpointIdD&gt;/&lt;ClusterName&gt;/Attributes/Reported</span></code>).</p>
<p>The state must be described both by a
<a class="reference external" href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Designing_MQTT_Topics_for_AWS_IoT_Core.pdf">“desired” and “reported” states</a>.</p>
<p>The desired state must be updated when the message has been received by the
Protocol Controller. When the message has been application layer acknowledged
by the PAN Node (“the garage door is now fully lowered and closed”), another
update must be published, this time changing the “reported” state. of
the Cluster attributes. The Supervision Command Class can be used to
obtain application level confirmations in Z-Wave.</p>

<p>A cache of recent status messages from the PAN SHOULD be maintained in the
GW to reduce the load on the PAN network when facing repeated queries from
the IoT Service. This Data Layer can be thought of as a continually updating
database of the total PAN state. Ideally, IoT Services should query this
self-refreshing Status Database, and never issue requests directly to the PAN.
The subscriptions may need a mechanism to signal the desired freshness of the
response, so the Data Caching component can decide to update the status before
responding. Data caching should probably be handled in each Protocol Controller.
The mechanism of distribution (Retained Messages in the MQTT broker) or a real

will allow multiple Unified Gateways to control the same PAN without multiplying
the amount of probing traffic needed to keep their individual status data bases

The Level cluster is trivially translated to UCL as Level cluster (same data
model in UCL and Zigbee makes this easy). The Protocol Controller publishes
the following Retained Message to allow service discovery:

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;Level:100&quot;,</span> <span class="pre">&quot;TransitionTime&quot;:5}</span></code> to topic
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ucl/by-group/1/Level/Commands/MoveToLevelWithOnOff</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Protocol Controller receives the message and issues a multicast message to
those nodes. If managed by two different Protocol Controllers, a singlecast
on each PHY will happen instead.</p></li>

<p><strong>Type 1: Cloud provider uses MQTT</strong></p>
<p>Assume that a contractor is commissioned to build an IoT service.
The IoT service connects UCL to a cloud solution of some sort. The contractor
picks a MQTT client in a preferred language (in this use case Python),
subscribes to relevant channels on the Unify broker, and publishes
translated-to-cloud-solution commands to the cloud solution and vice-verse.</p>
<p>Translation should be a lot simpler than the Protocol Controllers due to
structural similarities btw. UCL and prevalent IoT cloud solution architectures.
For example, both AWS IoT and Azure IoT uses MQTT transport and fits in this
category (AWS IoT is agnostic to the payload/data model, but UCL must be
translated to the data model of the cloud service being targeted, so some
translation is still needed).</p>
<p><strong>Type 2: Cloud provider does not use MQTT:</strong></p>
<p>Add MQTT client, subscribe to stuff on the GW broker, translate and transmit
to cloud provider in whatever transport and format they use. This requires
more work than type 1, obviously, but is still significantly easier than
pre-Unify solutions.</p>

<p>Contractor chooses an MQTT client in a preferred language and starts
implementing the APIs detailed above in the Protocol Controller API section.
Preferably, the contractor has in-depth knowledge of the PHY in question.</p>
