# Unify SDK

The Unify SDK is the main source for Silicon Labs customers who are working with Linux based applications. While developing IoT products that leverage a Linux operating system, such as an IoT gateway or an advanced IoT end device, additional software is needed to interface with the IoT radio and provide interoperability with the host application. To equip customers developing complex IoT applications for single or multi-protocol use cases, Silicon Labs has created a software framework that simplifies the developer experience, removing difficult parts of network control and network management as it relates to gateway and hub development in IoT applications. It can also provide Matter bridge functionality to other protocols that do not natively run matter.

Here is an overview of the components delivered with this repo.
