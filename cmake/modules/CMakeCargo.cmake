# cmake-format: off
# This file specifies the build of Rust packages. For usage, skip to function
# `cargo_build`. The goal designing these scripts was to be able to build Rust
# packages as fast as possible. We try to achieve this by having as less as
# custom targets as possible. And let cargo do as much as buildsystem work for
# us. "Dont fight the cargo buildsystem!"
# 1. Cargo is quite aggressive in flagging packages dirty, a slight change in an
# environment variable or configuration will trigger an rebuild. more about
# this in Cargo Fingerprinting.
# 2. Cargo manages a lot of build configuration. based on experience we saw that
# its very hard to inject custom configuration via additional flags without
# it conflicted or even simply being ignored.
#
# In theory you dont have to do anything in order for your new Rust package
# to get build as Cargo will handle this for us. However you still might want
# to declare your Rust packages with `cargo_build` as it enables more
# features:
# - export of your Rust package as actual cmake targets. see `add_cmake_target`
# this means you can integrate it easy into other cmake targets.
# - Debian package generation.
# - building a single Rust package.
#
# These targets will be created on top of the cargo_build.
#
# # Cargo Fingerprinting
# Cargo generates fingerprint files which are used to determin if a rebuild
# should happen. You can view the logging of them by passing the following
# variable to a cargo build:
# `CARGO_LOG=cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint=trace' Part of this fingerprint
# is a metadata hash, you can view it by passing `-vvv` to cargo build and looks
# like `-C metadata=295d6d3a59043349 -C extra-filename=-295d6d3a59043349`. This
# hash is based on various things including Rust compiler version, rustc binary,
# environment, package configuration, passed flags etc. Since we have no means
# to overwrite this metadata hash we are quite limited in what we can do before
# an rebuild happens. One of the reasons why we went for a cmake target to build
# everything. We tried to build specific packages as well, but this again gave
# poor performance.
#
# to see more specifically, whats inculded in the hash, you can take a look in
# the source of cargo metadata:
# src/cargo/core/compiler/context/compilation_files.rs:compute_metadata
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2904
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6529
